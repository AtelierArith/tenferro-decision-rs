# tenferro-decision-rs

A Rust typed-decision inference stack built on
[tenferro-rs](https://github.com/tensor4all/tenferro-rs): **Laya** first, then
**Jeff**, then the remote **Jev** client.

The design package lives in [`docs/agents/specs/`](docs/agents/specs/README.md).
Read `06_ROADMAP.md` for the phase plan and `01_DESIGN.md` for the crate
architecture.

## Workspace

| crate | role |
|---|---|
| `decision-core` | Backend-independent questions/answers, `Content`, and the `DecisionEngine` seam |
| `tenferro-infer` | Shared inference primitives (norm, activations, softmax, RoPE, attention) |
| `laya-infer` | Laya engine (planned) |
| `jeff-infer` | Jeff engine (planned) |
| `tenferro-gated-delta` | Gated DeltaNet crate for Jeff (planned) |
| `jev-client` | Independent TypeSafe System One API client (planned) |
| `reference-data` | Reference fixture format and loader (test support) |
| `bench-suite` | Benchmark harness skeleton and metadata capture |

`decision-core` and `jev-client` never depend on tenferro.

## Status

Phase 0 (workspace and baseline) is in place: the Cargo workspace,
`decision-core`, tenferro CPU dependency wiring, the reference fixture format,
the benchmark harness skeleton, and CI. Engine work starts at Phase 1
(`tenferro-infer` primitives).

## Building and testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p decision-core --features serde
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo bench -p bench-suite
```

The MVP targets the tenferro CPU provider (`cpu-faer`); CUDA follows in later
phases.
